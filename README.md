PC Horror game. Despite that this project is still super raw, almost all of the main mechanics and features are already implemented, including: 
Flexible interaction system + many interactable object behaviours (doors, items, buttons etc.), player behaviour + control object support (ladders, trolleys etc.), basic detection hud, basic ui system, sound management and scene loader. 

Warning! Since this project don't have a nice finished architecture yet, to make it work properly you should enter the play mode from the "Startup" scene.
If you want to start it from another one, make sure to copy "ProjectContext" object from startup into desired scene.

Also note, that this is only a demo. The bigger part of the content not related to the main mechanics was cut (except for the source code).
